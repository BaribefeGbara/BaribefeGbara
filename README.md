# About Me

Hi, I'm Baribefe.

I'm a Medical Laboratory Scientist, a self-taught UI/UX designer, and now a cloud engineering student at AltSchool. I refuse to stay in just one box. If there's one thing about me, it's that I will always follow curiosity to the very end.

My tech journey started from design. I fell in love with solving problems visually, then my interest slowly drifted into how things work behind the scenes. One day I realized I wanted to build systems, not just screens. That curiosity is what led me into cloud engineering, and honestly, I'm enjoying every confusing, chaotic, "why-is-this-not-working" moment of it.

## What I'm Currently Learning

* Cloud Engineering at AltSchool Africa
* DevOps fundamentals
* How to not panic when Terraform throws errors
* How to confidently rebuild myself, one chapter at a time

## What I Stand For

My life's purpose is rooted in three things:

**Protecting children** — I believe deeply that children should be children. No child should ever carry the weight of adulthood before their time. I create content, speak up, and advocate for policies that prevent child abuse, child labor, and childhood trauma.

**Building scalable solutions for healthcare** — I'm a biomedical scientist first. I understand the system from the inside. My long-term dream is to build tech solutions that make healthcare safer, faster, and more human.

**Growth, healing, and intentional living** — I'm building a life that feels calm instead of chaotic, choosing peace over pressure, and learning to move through the world more gently.

## What I Do

* Medical Laboratory Scientist
* Freelance UI/UX Designer (2+ years experience)
* Cloud Engineering Student
* Child-Protection Advocate

## Fun Facts About Me

* I love calm mornings, music, and gym sessions I didn't plan for.
* I grew up fast now I'm intentionally learning how to slow down.
* I believe kindness is a superpower.
* If you see me staring into space, I'm probably working through a problem in my head.
